# Manage doxx.net Firewall

> **Live schema first.** The doxx.net Config API is agent-descriptive. Fetch `https://config.doxx.net/` for the current manifest (every endpoint, params, returns, auth, side effects): this file is a snapshot. Every POST response also includes a `context` field with per-endpoint docs.

You help users manage firewall rules on their doxx.net tunnels. This controls which tunnels can talk to each other (mesh networking) and which ports are open to the internet.

## Setup

Requires either the `DOXXNET_TOKEN` environment variable (preferred) or a token file at `~/.config/doxxnet/token`. If neither is set, tell the user to run `export DOXXNET_TOKEN=your-token`.

## API convention

**Auth token -- never enters the AI conversation.**

The token is passed to `curl` via shell expansion, so its plaintext value stays on your machine. Two sources, checked in this order:

1. `$DOXXNET_TOKEN` env var (preferred): user exports it before launching the agent.
2. `~/.config/doxxnet/token` file: used automatically if the env var is unset.

curl commands below use `${DOXXNET_TOKEN:-$(cat ~/.config/doxxnet/token)}`, so both work transparently. The shell expands the value at exec time -- the plaintext is never emitted in a tool call to the LLM.

**Config API**: POST to `https://config.doxx.net/v1/`:
```
curl -s -X POST https://config.doxx.net/v1/ -d "ENDPOINT=1&param=value&token=${DOXXNET_TOKEN:-$(cat ~/.config/doxxnet/token)}"
```

## Endpoints

- `firewall_rule_list`: list all firewall rules. Optional: `tunnel_token`
- `firewall_rule_add`: add a rule. Params: `tunnel_token`, `protocol` (TCP/UDP/ICMP/ALL), `src_ip`, `src_port`, `dst_ip`, `dst_port`
- `firewall_rule_delete`: delete a rule. Same params as add.
- `firewall_link_all_toggle`: toggle mesh networking. Params: `enabled` (1 or 0)
- `firewall_link_all_status`: check if mesh networking is enabled
- `list_tunnels`: list tunnels (to get assigned IPs for rules)

## Common patterns

**Home server accessible from all devices:**
1. Enable link-all: `firewall_link_all_toggle=1&enabled=1`
2. Open specific ports to internet if needed (e.g., 443 for web server)

**Only laptop + phone can see each other:**
1. Keep link-all disabled
2. Add bidirectional rules between the two tunnels

**Open SSH on a server tunnel:**
- `firewall_rule_add=1&tunnel_token=TT&protocol=TCP&src_ip=0.0.0.0/0&src_port=ALL&dst_ip=TUNNEL_IP&dst_port=22`

## Guidelines

- Always list current rules before making changes
- Get tunnel IPs from `list_tunnels`: you need the `assigned_ip` for rules
- For mesh networking between two tunnels, always create bidirectional rules (A->B and B->A)
- Confirm with the user before deleting rules
- Prefer link-all over manual rules when the user wants full mesh
